# 🧪 Pancreatitis Lab Checker + ML

This project is a **Pancreatitis Lab Report Checker** built using **JavaScript** and enhanced with **Machine Learning** for better prediction accuracy.
It allows users to input their lab test results and get a possible risk score of pancreatitis.

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This project is for **educational purposes only**. It is **NOT a medical device**. Do not panic if the system shows a high risk — please **consult a doctor immediately** for professional diagnosis and treatment.

## 🚑 Required Lab Reports

To check the possibility of **Pancreatitis**, the following lab values are required:

* **Amylase** (Normal: 30 – 110 U/L)
* **Lipase** (Normal: 0 – 160 U/L)
* **Calcium (Ca²⁺)** (Normal: 8.5 – 10.2 mg/dL)
* **Potassium (K⁺)** (Normal: 3.5 – 5.0 mmol/L)
* **Magnesium (Mg²⁺)** (Normal: 1.7 – 2.2 mg/dL)
* **C-Reactive Protein (CRP)** (Normal: <10 mg/L)
* **White Blood Cell Count (WBC)** (Normal: 4,000 – 11,000 /µL)
* **ALT (SGPT)** (Normal: 7 – 55 U/L)
* **AST (SGOT)** (Normal: 8 – 48 U/L)
* **Bilirubin (Total)** (Normal: 0.3 – 1.2 mg/dL)
* **Albumin** (Normal: 3.5 – 5.0 g/dL)
* **Vitamin D** (Normal: 20 – 50 ng/mL)
* **Fasting Blood Sugar** (Normal: 70 – 100 mg/dL)

The system checks these values against normal ranges and predicts a **possible risk of Pancreatitis**.

1. **Download the Project**

   * Download the `.zip` file from GitHub.
   * Extract it to your desired folder.

2. **Install Dependencies**

   * Open the **Terminal** in the extracted folder.

     npm run dev
     ```
   * A **local development link** will appear (e.g., `http://localhost:5173/`).
   * Open it in your browser.

4. **Check Pancreatitis Risk**

   * Enter your lab report values.
   * Run **Rule-based Check** or **Predict with ML**.
   * The system will show a possible result and **ML Risk Score**.
